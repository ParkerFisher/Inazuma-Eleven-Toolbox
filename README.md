# Inazuma-Eleven-Stats-Extractor
Extracts data from `unitstat.dat` and `unitbase.dat`

## Usage
You need some additional files in order to run this program.
i'm not providing these files since i'm not sure whether or not if it's legal to do so.
The files i'm talking about are `unitstat.dat` and `unitbase.dat`

These files are located in `"/Extracted-ROM-Directory/data_iz/logic/en"` for IE1 & 2.
For IE3 it's `"/Extracted-ROM-Directory/romfs/archive_op_fa/en/inazuma3_ogre/data_iz/logic"`

NOTE: The filesystem may be different for Lightning Bolt and bomb blast.

Drag and drop the `unitstat.dat` and `unitbase.dat` in `"/Inazuma-Eleven-Stats-Extractor/Include/$(REGION)/XXX"`
XXX for Inazuma Eleven 1, 2 or 3 (IE, IE2, IE3)

When loading the program make sure you select the correct game version and region

## Notes
Unobtainable players and NPCs are also present in this list.
