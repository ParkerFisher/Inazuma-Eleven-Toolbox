# Inazuma-Eleven-Toolbox
Work in progress program for editing files of the First 3 Inazuma Eleven games

## Usage
Save Editor: Currently viewer Only, i'm working a lot on this so it will probably be possible to edit your saves soon.

Stats Viewer: You need unitstat.dat and unitbase.dat in "/Game Files/$(Region)/$(Game)/".
I'm not provding these files since i'm not certain wheter or not that would be legal.
